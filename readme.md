# 🛡️ Lock Windows 10 – Block Windows 11 Forever

No nags. No tricks. No forced reboots.  
Just keep your Windows 10 forever — because **that's why you're here**.

---

## 💻 Manifesto

> **Mac is for your eyes.**  
> **Windows exists for DirectX.**  
> **Linux exists for everything else.**

That's it. No one should be forced into an OS switch just because Microsoft wants numbers on a graph.

## ✅ What This Does

- Freezes your system at **Windows 10 – 22H2**
- Blocks Windows 11 upgrades permanently
- Silences all banners, nags, and appraiser checks
- Deletes the Upgrade Assistant and stops it from coming back
- Does **not** block normal Windows 10 security updates

## 🧠 How to Use

1. Download `lock_windows10.bat`
2. Right-click → **Run as Administrator**
3. You're done.

## 💥 Why It Matters

> You're not here to debug Windows.  
> You're not here for telemetry.  
> You're here to play.

This script respects that.
